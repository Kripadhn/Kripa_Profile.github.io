Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Gandhi Institute of Engg and Technologies,  Gunupur](https://www.giet.edu/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020).
I have also completed my Executive Post Graduate Programme in Management at IIM Kozhikode( 2012- 2014) in Operations and Systems (https://www.iimk.ac.in/).   

I'm currently working as a Senior Technical Lead for **Ernst & Young GDS** in the Digital Emerging Technologies unit. My responsibilty includes API Development using Azure Cloud and .Net Core. 

I'm also an [Innovation Agent] fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at EY GDS, India.
